# luFactor
## LU Decomposition Algorithm
"luFactor" function is an algorithm that outputs the LU facotrization and pivoting matrix of an inputed matrix [A] to solve a system of equations. The inputs are : "A", which is a matrix of the coefficients in a system of equations. The outputs are: "L", which is a lower triangular matrix of the lower limit of [A], "U", which is an upper triangular matrix of the upper limit of [A], (where [A]=[L][U]), and "P", which is the patial pivot matrix of [A].
